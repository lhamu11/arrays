# arrays

The following have been accomplished in this file:

Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.
Create a new array whose elements is in uppercase of words present in the original array.
Use the .map() method on the heros array to return a new array.
The new array should rename the 'name' key to 'hero'.
The new array should have a new key added called (id).
The key 'id' should be based on the index.


The input format that has been worked on is:

let myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];
let strings = ["avengers", "captain america", "ironman", "black panther"];

const heros = [ { name: 'Spider-Man' }, { name: 'Thor' }, { name: 'Black Panther' }, { name: 'Captain Marvel' }, { name: 'Silver Surfer' } ];

const inputWords = ["spray", "limit", "elite", "exuberant", "destruction", "present"];

//find the sum of all elements in an array;

//print even nos. till 'n' with loop

//create a function accepting number argument and 
//countdown till 0 and log 'done' on console


//print array in reverse order in loop


//pum(1)(2)(3)// implement this with the result as 6
